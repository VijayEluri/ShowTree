About ShowTree

ShowTree was written by Yuvi Masory, then a computer science 
student at the University of Pennsylvania, as part of his senior project
 on tree visualization in 2009.

Entering "0" for arity allows trees of unbounded degree.

The following code is borrowed:

A1] Image saving files are borrowed from Donald Derrick's excellent 
GPL (v2+) TreeForm Syntax Drawing Software. His code was also valuable
for debugging the W_BJL06 implementation. For more information visit:

A2] Code for opening saved trees uses PDTB API (Common Public 
License) For more information visit:
