# ShowTree #
## A Java Swing application for producing pretty drawings of trees (i.e., acyclic connected graphs). ##

### Overview ###

I wrote this program as the "applied" part of my senior project on tree visualization.
Even though I wrote it as a student, someone may find the tree positioning code useful.

**See src/about.txt for more info.**
